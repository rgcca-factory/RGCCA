RGCCA subsumes fifty years multiblock component methods defined following optimization problem: $$\\underset{\\mathbf a_1, \\dots, \\mathbf a_J}{\\text{maximize}} \\sum_{j, k = 1}^J c_{jk} g(\\text{cov}(\\mathbf X_j \\mathbf a_j, \\mathbf X_k \\mathbf a_k)) \\text{ s.t. } (1 - \\tau_j)\\text{var}(\\mathbf X_j \\mathbf a_j) + \\tau_j \\Vert \\mathbf a_j \\Vert^2 = 1, ~ j = 1, \\dots, J.$$ scheme function g continuous convex function allows consider different optimization criteria.

Usually, cjk = 1 two connected blocks 0 otherwise. τj called shrinkage parameters regularization parameters ranging 0 1. τj enables interpolate smoothly maximizing covariance maximizing correlation. Setting τj 0 force block components unit variance (var(Xjaj) = 1). case, covariance criterion boils correlation. correlation criterion better explaining correlated structure across datasets, thus discarding variance within individual dataset. Setting τj 1 normalize block weight vectors (‖aj‖ = 1), applies covariance criterion. value 0 1 lead compromise two first options correspond following constraint (1−τj)var(Xjaj) + τj‖aj‖2 = 1.
