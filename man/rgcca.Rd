\arguments{
\item{blocks}{A list that contains the \eqn{J} blocks of variables
\eqn{\mathbf{X_1}, \mathbf{X_2}, ..., \mathbf{X_J}}{X1, X2, ..., XJ}.
Block \eqn{\mathbf{X}_j}{Xj} is a matrix of dimension
\eqn{n \times p_j}{n x p_j} where \eqn{n} is the number of
observations and \eqn{p_j} the number of variables. The blocks argument can
be also a fitted cval, rgcca or permutation object.}

\item{connection}{A (\eqn{J \times J}{J x J}) symmetric matrix describing
the network of connections between blocks (default value: 1-diag(J)).}

\item{tau}{Either a numerical value, a numeric vector of size
\eqn{J}{J}, or a
numeric matrix of dimension
\eqn{\mathrm{max}(\textrm{ncomp}) \times J}{max(ncomp) x J}
containing the values of the regularization parameters
(default: tau = 1, for each
block and each dimension), or a string equal to "optimal".
The regularization parameters varies from 0 (maximizing the correlation) to
1 (maximizing the covariance).

If tau is a numerical
value, tau is identical across all constraints applied to all
block weight vectors.

If tau is a vector, tau[j] is used for the constraints applied to
all the block weight vectors associated to block \eqn{\mathbf X_j}{Xj}.

If tau is a matrix, tau[k, j] is associated with the constraints
applied to the kth block weight vector corresponding to block
\eqn{\mathbf X_j}{Xj}.

If tau = "optimal" the regularization
parameters are estimated for each block and each dimension using the Schafer
and Strimmer (2005) analytical formula. The tau parameters can also be
estimated using
\link{rgcca_permutation} or \link{rgcca_cv}.}

\item{ncomp}{A numerical value or a vector of length \eqn{J} indicating
the number of components per block. If a single value is provided,
the same number of components is extracted for every block.}

\item{scheme}{A string or a function specifying the scheme function applied
to
covariance maximization among "horst" (the identity function), "factorial"
 (the square function - default value), "centroid" (the absolute value
 function). The scheme function can be any continuously differentiable convex
 function and it is possible to design explicitly the scheme function
 (e.g. function(x) x^4) as argument of the function.  See (Tenenhaus et al,
 2017) for details.}

\item{scale}{A logical value indicating if variables are standardized.}

\item{init}{A string giving the type of initialization to use in
the RGCCA algorithm. It could be either by
Singular Value Decompostion ("svd")
or by random initialization ("random") (default: "svd").}

\item{bias}{A logical value for biased (\eqn{1/n}) or unbiased
(\eqn{1/(n-1)}) estimator of the variance/covariance
(default: bias = TRUE).}

\item{tol}{The stopping value for the convergence of the algorithm
(default: tol = 1e-08).}

\item{verbose}{A logical value indicating if the progress of the
algorithm is reported while computing.}

\item{scale_block}{A logical value or a string indicating if each block is
scaled.

If TRUE or "inertia", each block is divided by the sum of eigenvalues
of its empirical covariance matrix.

If "lambda1", each block is divided by
the square root of the highest eigenvalue of its empirical covariance matrix.

If standardization is applied (scale = TRUE), the block scaling applies on
the standardized blocks.}

\item{method}{A string specifying which multiblock component
method to consider. Possible values are found using
\link{available_methods}.}

\item{sparsity}{Either a numerical value, a numeric vector of
size \eqn{J} or a numeric matrix
of dimension \eqn{\textrm{max}(\textrm{ncomp}) \times J} encoding the L1
constraints applied to the
block weight vectors. For block \eqn{j}, the amount of
sparsity varies between
\eqn{1/\textrm{sqrt}(p_j)} and 1 (larger values of sparsity
correspond to less penalization).

If sparsity is a numerical value, then sparsity is identical across
all constraints applied to all block weight vectors.

If sparsity is a vector, sparsity[j] is identical across the constraints
applied to the block weight vectors associated to block
\eqn{\mathbf X_j}{Xj}:
\deqn{
   \forall k, \Vert a_{j,k} \Vert_{1} \le \textrm{sparsity}[j] \sqrt{p_j}.
}{for all k, ||ajk||1 <= sparsity(j) sqrt(pj).}

If sparsity is a matrix, sparsity[k, j] is associated with the constraints
applied to the kth block weight vector corresponding to block
\eqn{\mathbf X_j}{Xj}:
\deqn{
   \Vert a_{j,k}\Vert_{1} \le \textrm{sparsity}[k,j] \sqrt{p_j}.
}{||ajk||1 <= sparsity(k, j) sqrt(pj).}

The sparsity parameter can be estimated by using \link{rgcca_permutation} or
\link{rgcca_cv}.}

\item{response}{A numerical value giving the position of the response block.
When the response argument is filled, the supervised mode is automatically
activated.}

\item{superblock}{A logical value indicating if the
superblock option is used.}

\item{NA_method}{A string indicating the method used for
handling missing values ("na.ignore", "na.omit"). (default: "na.ignore").
\itemize{
\item "na.omit" corresponds to perform RGCCA on the fully observed
observations (observations from which missing values have been removed).
\item "na.ignore" corresponds to perform RGCCA algorithm on available
data (See Tenenhaus et al, 2005).}}

\item{quiet}{A logical value indicating if some diagnostic messages
are reported.}

\item{n_iter_max}{Integer giving the algorithm's maximum number of
iterations.}

\item{comp_orth}{A logical value indicating if the deflation should lead to
orthogonal block components or orthogonal block weight vectors.}

\item{rank}{Either an integer, an integer vector of
size \eqn{J} or an integer matrix
of dimension \eqn{\textrm{max}(\textrm{ncomp}) \times J} giving the rank
of the decomposition sought for the canonical vectors in TGCCA.
If block \eqn{j} is an array with at least three dimensions, rank must be
comprised between 1 and the number of variables on the mode bearing the
orthogonality constraint. See \eqn{\textrm{mode_orth}}.}

\item{mode_orth}{Either an integer or an integer vector of size \eqn{J}
designating the mode which associated set of factors will be orthogonal
in the decomposition sought by TGCCA. If block \eqn{j} is an array with
\eqn{d > 2} dimensions, \eqn{\textrm{mode_orth}} must be comprised between
1 and \eqn{d - 1}.}

\item{separable}{A logical value if the regularization matrices must be
estimated as separable matrices (i.e. products of Kronecker products
matching the dimensions of the modes in the data).}

\item{A}{Deprecated argument, please use blocks instead.}

\item{C}{Deprecated argument, please use connection instead.}

\item{Y}{A list of \eqn{J} elements. The jth element
of the list \eqn{Y}
is a matrix that contains the block components for block j.}

\item{a}{A list of \eqn{J} elements. The jth element
of the list \eqn{a}
is a matrix that contains the block weight vectors for block j.}

\item{astar}{A list of \eqn{J} elements. Each column of astar[[j]] is
a vector such that Y[[j]] = blocks[[j]] \%*\% astar[[j]].}

\item{crit}{A list of vector of length max(ncomp). Each vector of
the list is related to one specific deflation stage and reports the values
of the criterion for this stage across iterations.}

\item{primal_dual}{A vector of length J. Element \eqn{j}{j}
is either "primal" or "dual", depending on whether the primal or dual
RGCCA algorithm was used for block \eqn{j}{j}.}

\item{AVE}{A list of numerical values giving the indicators of model
quality based on the Average Variance Explained (AVE): AVE(for each block),
AVE(outer model), AVE(inner model).}

Strimmer formula was applied for estimating the optimal tau parameters.}

\item{opt}{A list containing some options of
the fitted RGCCA object.}

\item{blocks}{A list that contains the \eqn{J}
blocks of variables
\eqn{\mathbf X_1, \mathbf X_2, \dots, \mathbf X_J}{X1, X2, ..., XJ}.
Block \eqn{\mathbf X_j}{Xj} is a matrix of dimension
\eqn{n \times p_j}{n x pj} where \eqn{p_j}{pj} is the number of
variables in \eqn{\mathbf X_j}{Xj}. These blocks are preprocessed
according to the values of
scale/scale_block/NA_method.}

\description{
RGCCA is a general statistical framework for multiblock data analysis.
The rgcca() function implements this framework and is the main entry point
of the package.
}
\details{
Given \eqn{J}{J} data matrices
\eqn{\mathbf X_1, \mathbf X_2, \dots, \mathbf X_J}{X1, X2, ..., XJ}
that represent \eqn{J}{J} sets of variables
observed on the same set of \eqn{n}{n} individuals. These matrices
\eqn{\mathbf X_1, \mathbf X_2, \dots, \mathbf X_J}{X1, X2, ..., XJ},
called blocks must have the same number of rows, but may (and usually will)
have different numbers of columns.

RGCCA aims to study the relationships between these \eqn{J}{J} blocks.
It constitutes a general framework for many multi-block component methods
(see Tenenhaus and Tenenhaus, 2011 ; Tenenhaus et al. 2017). It combines the
power of multi-block data analysis  methods (maximization of well identified
criteria) and the flexibility of PLS path modeling (the researcher decides
which blocks are connected and which are not). Hence, the use of RGCCA
requires the construction (user specified) of a design matrix
\eqn{\mathbf C}{C} that
characterizes the connections between blocks. Elements of the (symmetric)
design matrix \eqn{\mathbf C = (c_{jk})}{C = (c_{jk})}
are positive (and usually equal to 1 if blocks \eqn{j}{j}
and \eqn{k}{k} are connected, and 0 otherwise).
The rgcca() function implements
a monotone global convergent algorithm: the bounded criteria to be
maximized increases at each step of the iterative procedure and hits, at
convergence, a stationary point of the RGCCA optimization problem.

Moreover,
when the tau argument is used, depending on the dimensionality of each block
\eqn{\mathbf X_j, j = 1, \ldots, J}{Xj, j = 1, \ldots, J},
the primal algorithm (when \eqn{n \geq p_j}{n >= p_j}) or the dual algorithm
(when \eqn{n < p_j}{n < p_j}) is used (see Tenenhaus et al. 2015).

When sparsity is
specified SGCCA, extends RGCCA to address the issue of variable selection
(Tenenhaus et al, 2014). Specifically, RGCCA is combined with an L1-penalty
that gives rise to Sparse GCCA (SGCCA). The SGCCA algorithm is very similar
to the RGCCA algorithm and keeps the same convergence properties (i.e. the
bounded criteria to be maximized increases at each step of the iterative
procedure and hits at convergence a stationary point).

At last, a deflation strategy can be used to compute several block
components
(specified by ncomp) per block. Within each block, components or weight
vectors are guaranteed to be orthogonal. It should be noted that the numbers
of components per block can differ from one block to another.

The rgcca() function handle missing values (punctual or blockwise missing
structure) using the algorithm described in (Tenenhaus et al, 2005).

Guidelines describing how to use RGCCA in practice are provided in
(Garali et al., 2018).
